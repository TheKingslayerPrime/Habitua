# Habitua

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Introduction: 
Welcome to the introduction of the website of Habitua! Our objective is to create a personal development journey tracker. Through this website, the customers can seamlessly navigate through and use the various personal development tools provided to assist them in their personal development journey. The website contains a habit tracker, a to-do list, a pomodoro timer and a cat mascot. The cat mascot will appear hungry or satisfied based on the state of the tasks given. If the tasks are done in an orderly manner, then the cat will appear satisfied. If not, then the cat will appear hungry and unsatisfied.

Key Features of the Website:
1. Login Page- Users can use the beautifully designed login page to log in to the Habitua dashboard.
2. Task List- Users can list down their tasks in the task list to keep a track of them in an orderly manner.
3. Habits List- Users can note down their regular habits to keep track of them in an efficient manner.
4. Pomodoro Timer - The Habitua dashboard also features a pomodoro timer for time tracking. The timer is set to 20 mins as is the convention for most pomodoro timers.
5. Cat Mascot - The dashboard also features a well designed cat mascot to motivate the user to complete their tasks. When the tasks are not completed in an orderly manner, the mascot appears hungry and unsatisfied. When the tasks are completed, the mascot becomes satisfied.

Technologies used: 
1. Django Framework - This framework can be used for a strong, dependable and scalable backend.
2. CSS - Basic CSS is used to style the website alongside CSS.
3. JS - Vanilla JS is used to add interactivity to the Habitua dashboard.
